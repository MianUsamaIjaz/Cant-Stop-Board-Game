- **Set-Up Menu**: Fully implemented set-up menu allowing players to view instructions, save the game, load a saved game, roll the dice, and more.
- **Accurate Game Logic**: The game accurately records players' points, locks out columns already claimed by players, and includes them in the potential busting logic.
- **Game End Detection**: Accurately determines when the game ends and closes the game afterwards.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

The Cant Stop Board Game is built using the following technologies:

- **Java**: A versatile and widely-used programming language for building applications.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Utilizes object-oriented principles for organizing code and implementing game logic.
- **Swing**: A Java GUI toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces.
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes and collaborating on the project.
- **GitHub**: Hosting platform for storing and sharing the project repository.

## üöÄ Getting Started

**Note: Please make sure that all the files including images are in the same folder!**

## üíª Gameplay

- Players take turns rolling four dice and grouping them into two pairs to form their moves.
- After each roll, players can choose to advance on the game board by combining the values of their dice.
- The goal is to reach the top of three columns on the board by successfully advancing on each column.
- Players can strategically choose when to end their turn or continue rolling dice to increase their progress.
- The first player to reach the top of three columns wins the game.


## ‚úÖ Objectives Accomplished:

  - The set-up menu for the game is fully implemented, along with all actions able to be taken by the user (this includes but is not limited to viewing the
    instructions, saving the game, loading the game, rolling the dice, etc...)
  
  - Both levels of difficulty for the AI, Easy and Hard. Easy AI takes actions randomly 50% of the time. Hard AI always takes 2 turns, and it
    will always pick the sequence of numbers so it does not bust according to the issue stated above, so the AI will (almost) never bust during the game.
  
  - Color deficiency feature was added using a color palette according to this link: https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40.
    Color deficiency option can be selected during the set-up of the game.
  
  - The game accurately records the points a player has, locks out columns which are already claimed and includes them in potential busting logic, and accurately
    determines when the game ends and closes the game afterwards.

## üìù Important Notes:

  - There is currently an issue with player tiles overlapping with each other. At the moment the color of a player who have recently taken a turn will be displayed     on the top. But it stores the colors on the specific location so it makes no difference in functionality of the game.
  
  - For the testing purposes of the game, you can roll the dices many times during a turn, while in real life it should be only one roll per turn.
